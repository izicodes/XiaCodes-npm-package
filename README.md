<h1 align=center>☆ XiaCodes npm Package ☆</h1>

![image](screenshot.jpg)

<p align=justify>I created my first npm package! This project was inspired by <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/kitkatcodes" target="_blank" >@kitkatcodes</a>' post on a tutorial she followed on creating npm packages, and I wanted to give it a go! It was really fun making it, and I'm thrilled to share my own npm package with you!</p>

## ☆ Project Journey

<p align=justify>It took me around 3 hours to complete this project. Initially, I followed the tutorial mentioned by @kitkatcodes (which you can find here) to grasp the concept of creating an npm package. However, I couldn't resist adding my personal touch by playing around with colors and appearance, as I often do when coding. After some creative exploration, I finally completed the package and published it!</p>
